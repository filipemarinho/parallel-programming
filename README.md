Theme: Rich Club Coefficient in Graphs

Wikipedia Definition:[^origin]

 The rich-club coefficient is a metric on graphs and networks, designed to measure the extent to which well-connected nodes also connect to each other. Networks which have a relatively high rich-club coefficient are said to demonstrate the rich-club effect and will have many connections between nodes of high degree. The rich-club coefficient was first introduced in 2004 in a paper studying Internet topology.[^1][^2]

 The "Rich-club" effect has been measured and noted on scientific collaboration networks and air transportation networks. It has been shown to be significantly lacking on protein interaction networks.
